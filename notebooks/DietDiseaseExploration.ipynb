Low access, diet-related diseases, race, poverty, geography and other factors are considered by using open government data. For some context, this problem is a more and more relevant problem for the United States as obesity and diabetes rise and two out of three adult Americans are considered obese, one third of American minors are considered obsese, nearly ten percent of Americans have diabetes and nearly fifty percent of the African American population have heart disease. Even more, cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year, and rising. Native American populations more often than not do not have grocery stores on their reservation... and all of these trends are on the rise. The problem lies not only in low access to fresh produce, but food culture, low education on healthy eating as well as racial and income inequality.\n\nThe government data used in this journey is aggregated from the original, government data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics https://www.bls.gov/cex/ and The United States Department of Agriculture https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/.\n\n\nThe aggregated data is hosted here - https://ibm.box.com/s/058spwk7hvo8z2xguzr5jxsdjssbbvdl", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Import Dependencies", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "from io import StringIO\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "## Load Dataset\n\nTo get the data and load it into a pandas DataFrame:\n\n1.
