# Processing and Understanding Employee Attrition Data

This walkthrough was adapted from the code pattern found here - https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/data-science-life-cycle-in-action-to-solve-employee-attrition-problem/

This code pattern is analyzing the employee attrition problem. The dataset used in the code pattern is supplied by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and contains HR analytics data of employees that stay and leave. The types of data include metrics such as education level, job satisfactions, and commmute distance. The data is made available under the [Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/) license agreements and can also be downloaded directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/home).

## Components & Technologies

- [IBM Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio): Analyze data using RStudio, Jupyter, and Python in a configured, collaborative environment that includes IBM value-adds, such as managed Spark.
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/): An open source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text.
- [PixieDust](https://github.com/pixiedust/pixiedust): Provides a Python helper library for IPython Notebook.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A Python library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures.
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#): Free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
- Data Visualization tools: Bokeh, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pygal and Plotly.
